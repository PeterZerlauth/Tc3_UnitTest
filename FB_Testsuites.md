# FB_Testsuites Function Block Documentation

## Description
The `FB_Testsuites` function block is a part of TwinCAT 3 and serves as a manager for executing testsuites. It extends the `FB_Base` function block and implements the `I_Testsuites` interface.

## Properties

### P_Data
- **Type:** Reference to `ST_Testsuites`
- **Description:** Provides access to the data structure containing information about the testsuites, such as the number of tests, failures, errors, etc.

### P_List
- **Type:** `I_ListSTRING`
- **Description:** Provides access to the list of testsuites. It allows adding, removing, and managing testsuites within the function block.

### P_Options
- **Type:** Reference to `ST_TestsuitesOptions`
- **Description:** Allows configuration of options for the testsuites, such as file paths, logging options, etc.

## Methods

### M_Add
- **Type:** Public Method
- **Description:** Adds a testsuite to the list of testsuites managed by the function block.
- **Parameters:**
  - `Testsuite`: Input parameter of type `I_Testsuite`. Represents the testsuite to be added.

### M_Execute
- **Type:** Protected Method
- **Description:** Executes all testsuites in the list sequentially.
- **Parameters:** None.

### M_Starting
- **Type:** Protected Method
- **Description:** Initializes the testsuites for execution, setting up necessary configurations and preparing for execution.
- **Parameters:** None.

### M_Stopping
- **Type:** Protected Method
- **Description:** Stops the execution of testsuites and performs cleanup tasks.
- **Parameters:** None.

## Detailed Behavior

- **Initialization:** 
  - When instantiated, the function block initializes its internal data structures and sets up default configurations.
- **Adding Testsuites:** 
  - Testsuites can be added using the `M_Add` method, which appends them to the list of testsuites.
- **Executing Testsuites:** 
  - The `M_Execute` method executes all testsuites in the list sequentially, monitoring their progress and updating the overall status.
- **Starting Tests:** 
  - The `M_Starting` method prepares the function block for test execution, initializing variables and configurations.
- **Stopping Tests:** 
  - The `M_Stopping` method stops the execution of tests, performs cleanup tasks, and optionally logs the results.
